# Cardiovascular-disease-risk_BRFSS-2020
This project applies machine learning to predict cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk using BRFSS 2020 Survey Data from the CDC. It explores key health indicators, develops predictive models, and analyzes trends to improve early detection. This research aims to enhance public health decision-making through data-driven analytics.
This project includes three important steps:
1) Data Analysis; summarizing and visualizing data
2) Data preparation, including selecting, preprocessing, and transforming data
3) Models evaluation, including testing options, exploring algorithms, and reporting results
